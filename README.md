# MyNotes-Application
An application to store notes, update notes and delete notes. One of my first projects made on Android Studio using Java, XML and SQLite database.

## What it is
MyNotes is a note storing application where a user can add a new note, view the already made notes, delete the unwanted notes and also mail an existing note.

### Home Activity
When you open the application you are greeted with the home page which contains two buttons that help you in making a new note or view existing notes.<br><br>
